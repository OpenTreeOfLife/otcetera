<p>Propinquity output documentation. The top-level docs are <a href="../index.html">here</a>.
<p>This directory holds the output of
a run of propinquity's <code>run_assessments.py</code> script.
That script checks for certain types of problems in the output of the pipeline.
<a href="./summary.json">summary.json</a> is a JSON representation of that data
and <a href="./log.txt">log.txt</a> is a text log of the assessments run 
(the text log will be empty if there are no errors).</p>
<p>The 5 checks run were:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>nickname of check</th><th>description</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>lost_taxa</code></td>
        <td>Check that otcetera's tc-taxonomy-parser and otc-unprune-solution-and-name-unnamed-nodes tools agree about the number of taxa that are not present in the solution</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>lost_taxa_included_in_tree</code></td>
        <td>Check that none of the taxa listed as "lost" are in the annotations file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>monophyly</code></td>
        <td>Check that the taxa from the monophyly tests listed in https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/germinator/blob/master/taxa/monophyly.csv are monophyletic in the tree.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>num_tips</code></td>
        <td>Check that the cleaned version of the taxonomy and the supertree have the same number of leaves</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>unsupported_nodes</code></td>
        <td>Check that none of the nodes listed in the annotations file are completely unsuported</td>
    </tr>
