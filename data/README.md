A set of inputs requires a consistent taxonomy. So the tests inputs
here have the naming convention:

    taxonomytag-treetag.tre

such that any combination of `treetag.tre` files with the same `taxonomytag`
should be using the same set of IDs.

The Ids in otcetera are the numeric suffixes to the labels in the trees.
