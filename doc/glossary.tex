\begin{compactenum}
\defitem{as complete}{defAsComplete} a phrase contrasting 2 trees.
    Tree $A$ is as complete as tree $B$ $\iff$
    leaf label set of $B$ is a subset of the leaf label set of $A$.\\
    In notation: $\leafLabels{B} \subseteq \leafLabels{A}$.
\defitem{cluster}{defCluster} the set of leaf nodes that are descendants
    of a node, $x$, is the cluster of $x$
\defitem{complete}{defComplete} as an adjective for a tree. Tree $A$ is complete $\iff$ the leaf label set
    of tree $A$ is identical to the the set of terminal taxa.
    In notation: $\leafLabels{B} = \leafLabels{\taxonomy}$
\defitem{display}{defDisplay} Tree $A$ displays an group, $x$, from tree $B$ $\iff$
    that $A$ is as complete as tree $B$ and the induced tree of $A$ limited to the 
    leaf label set of $B$ contains a cluster with labels identical to the label set of the cluster of $x$
\defitem{internal node}{defInternalNode} a node that is not the root or a leaf.
\defitem{leaf labels}{defLeafLabels} For our problems, the input trees have been aligned to a common
    taxonomy. 
    So referring to the leaf label set of a tree can be interpreted as
    ``the set of taxonomic identifiers that are mapped to the leaves of the tree''.
    The leaf label set of a node is the set of labels associated with the cluster of the node.\\
    Note that a leaf label is not necessarily a terminal taxon.
    In notation, $\leafLabels{x}$ is the leaf label set of $x$.
\defitem{more complete}{defMoreComplete} tree $A$ is {\em more complete} than tree $B$ $\iff$ the leaf
    label set of $B$ is a proper subset of the leaf label set of $A$. \\
    In notation, $\leafLabels{B} \subset \leafLabels{A}$.
\defitem{terminal taxon}{defTerminalTaxon} a taxonimic identifier for at taxon that
    has no children {\em in the taxonomy}.
\end{compactenum}
\section{Notation}
\begin{compactenum}
    \notitem{\leafLabels{x}} is the leaf label set of $x$.
    \notitem{\taxonomy} the taxonomic tree.
