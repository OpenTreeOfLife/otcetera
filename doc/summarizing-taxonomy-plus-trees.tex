\section{Background}
The \otol project is attempting to build a platform for summarizing what is known
    about phylogenetic relationships across all of Life.
Presenting an easy-to-interpret summary of trees that have been ``curated''
    is one component of that effort.
The project has decided that this summary should include a tree which
\begin{compactenum}
    \item can be served and browsed;
    \item contains annotations indicating which input trees support a particular grouping;
    \item has all of the tips of the taxonomy;
    \item displays as many of the groups in the input trees as is feasible;
    \item may utilize ranking of trees;
    \item (tentative) has no unsupported groups;
    \item (tentative) does not ``prefer'' lack of resolution (defined more thoroughly below)
\end{compactenum}
This is results in a new form of a supertree problem described below as the ``taxonomy-based tree summary'' problem.
\section{Taxonomy-based tree summary}
This is a special form of the supertree problem with the following 2 unusual features:
\begin{compactenum}
    \item at least one input (the taxonomic tree) is complete
    \item the taxonomic tree is considered to be the lowest ranked input
\end{compactenum}
