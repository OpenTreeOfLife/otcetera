Taxonomy-as-the-only-input summary:
Summary of checks of internal nodes names/Ids:
0 named internal nodes with an incorrect name.
0 unamed internal nodes which should have been named.
2 named internal nodes which correspond to no taxon.
    ott4 should not be named.
    ott12 should not be named.
1 internal nodes where flagged as being supported in some sense.
    This means each of these nodes was:
    supported by at least one non-taxonomic input tree or the internal node has a name.
The breakdown of the types of supported nodes:
    0 unnamed internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node.
    0 unnamed internal nodes supported by an input tree expanded tip node.
    0 unnamed internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node and another tree's expanded tip node.
    0 named internal nodes had no support (other than the name).
    1 named internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node.
    0 named internal nodes supported by an input tree expanded tip node.
    0 named internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node and another tree's expanded tip node.
The following counts refer to redundant internal nodes (out-degree = 1). These are considered supported if their child is supported.
    0 unnamed redundant internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node.
    0 unnamed redundant internal nodes supported by an input tree expanded tip node.
    0 unnamed redundant internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node and another tree's expanded tip node.
    0 redundant named internal nodes had no support (other than the name).
    0 redundant named internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node.
    0 redundant named internal nodes supported by an input tree expanded tip node.
    0 redundant named internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node and another tree's expanded tip node.
6 unsupported nodes had out-degree > 1
0 unsupported nodes had out-degree == 1 and were along a terminal path.
0 unsupported nodes had out-degree == 1 and were along an internal path.
7 total internal nodes checked.

Final summary:
7 internal nodes where flagged as being supported in some sense.
    This means each of these nodes was:
    supported by at least one non-taxonomic input tree or the internal node has a name.
The breakdown of the types of supported nodes:
    4 unnamed internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node.
    0 unnamed internal nodes supported by an input tree expanded tip node.

    0 named internal nodes had no support (other than the name).
    3 named internal nodes supported by an input tree internal node.
    0 named internal nodes supported by an input tree expanded tip node.
