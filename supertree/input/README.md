# Supertree input

You should populate this directory with the following files:

  1. `taxonomy.tre` - containing a newick representation of the taxonomy
    with the numeric suffixes of each label representing taxon Ids (OTT
    Ids in practice).
  2. `taxonomy.json` the about file for the taxonomic input
  3. `source-tree-ref.json` to TBA format for listing the tree IDs (study ID
    and perhaps a git SHA if a tree is pegged to a specific revision)
